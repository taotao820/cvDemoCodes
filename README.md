# myWorkDisplay
I want to apply for the front-end development positions,most of the following code is what I use the time to complete the work.
-The resume is my resume,I show it in the form of a web page.
-The project code is a fragment of my project.Because it involves confidentiality, so just put a section.
Third wheel...
